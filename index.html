        Here is my short dance/glitch film, Å®†3ƒ@ç+!
        <br>
        <br>
        Å®†3ƒ@ç+ is a short dance film that uses digital glitch to explore degradation and generation loss across
        multiple mediums. It layers and blends footage of a body dancing with the fractal textures of natural elements
        like trees and birds, creating a dense lattice of flickering colour, branching light, and human forms, all
        buried in pastel washes of cascading residuum.
