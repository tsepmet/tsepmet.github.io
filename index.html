			<h1>About Me</h1> <!-- the "h1" tag is for a top-level header -->
			<p>My name is friend. I design and build things for people. I build play experiences,
				installations, experimental video games, stories, communities, spaces, and events.</p> <!-- the "p" tag is for text -->
			<h2>Why</h2> <!-- the "h2" tag is for a second-level header -->
			<p>I'm curious about people: how we express, how we connect, and how we experience the world around us. I
				enjoy
				making things that invite people to think in different ways, bring people together, and allow people to
				imagine different possibilities.</p>
			<h2>How</h2>
			<p>I work with people. Together we think about goals, values, interaction, motivation, friction, barriers,
				and
				flow. I listen to people and spend time thinking, experimenting, building things, and then listening
				again.
