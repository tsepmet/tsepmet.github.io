    </h1>
    <p>
        Å®†3ƒ@ç+ is a short dance film that uses digital glitch to explore degradation and generation loss across
        multiple mediums. It layers and blends footage of a body dancing with the fractal textures of natural
        elements like trees and birds, creating a dense lattice of flickering colour, branching light, and human
        forms, all buried in pastel washes of cascading residuum.
