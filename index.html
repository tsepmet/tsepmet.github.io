			<h1>Å®†3ƒ@ç+</h1> <!-- the "h1" tag is for a top-level header -->
			<p>Å®†3ƒ@ç+ is a short dance film that uses digital glitch to explore degradation and generation loss across
				multiple mediums. It layers and blends footage of a body dancing with the fractal textures of natural
				elements like trees and birds, creating a dense lattice of flickering colour, branching light, and human
				forms, all buried in pastel washes of cascading residuum.</p> <!-- the "p" tag is for text -->
			<h2>Synopsis</h2> <!-- the "h2" tag is for a second-level header -->
			<p>A study of left overs, echoes, and traces, Å®†3ƒ@ç+ celebrates digital noise by mining texture and colour
				from disrupted video and sound files. The film reads as a moving painting or a palimpsest, where the
				invisible is made visible, borne out in strange gusts and tides. A digital wind blows throughout the
				video, reminiscent of the sands that cover and conversely uncover the vestiges of ancient organic life
				on the planet.
			</p>
			<h2>More synopsis, for those that love synopsis</h2>
			<p>Ghostly forms appear and disappear. The dancing body flows through a variety of iterations and
				representations, getting pulled into looping eddies of movement and repetition. Rendered digitally, the
				body is viewed in terms of its recursive nature, atomized into various disparate pieces which can be
				reconstructed and re-animated willy-nilly, producing a glitch body that is no longer beholden to
				physical and anatomical rules, a body torn asunder and set free.
